* tf-idf.rs

Create term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency datasets from text documents via Rust.

*** Usage
Execute the binary `./bin/sorted-tf-idf-list` with the following arguments:
- paths to input documents
- path to output file (JSON)

The output file will contain the tf-idf value for all input documents, and all terms found in them.

The terms are cleaned up first to remove irrelevant characters like punctuation/parentheses etc.

*** Example
#+begin_src shell
./bin/sorted-tf-idf-list <path_to_file_1> <path_to_file_2> <path_to_file_3> <path_to_output_file>
#+end_src
